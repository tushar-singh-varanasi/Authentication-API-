# Authentication-API-


 The Authentication API project has been developed to provide secure and efficient authentication services for user registration, 
 login, password reset and password change operations. The project is implemented using Django Rest Framework and JWT technology

 The user registration functionality allows new users to create an account by providing their basic information, such as name,
 email address, and password. The registration process involves user input validation and password hashing to ensure data security.

 The login functionality enables registered users to access their accounts by providing their email and password. 
 The login process involves user authentication using JWT technology, which generates a unique token for each user session.

 The password reset functionality allows registered users to reset their passwords in case they forget their current password. 
 This process involves sending an email to the user's registered email address with a link to a password reset page. 
 The link contains a unique token that is used to verify the user's identity and allow them to create a new password.

 Overall, the Authentication API project provides a robust and secure authentication system for user management,
  which can be integrated into various web applications to ensure data privacy and security.
